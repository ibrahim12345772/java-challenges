Chapter 2 Challenge: The Applet Archaeologist
---------------------------------------------

1. SECURITY:
   Based on the Java "sandbox" model, an applet cannot:
   - Access local files on the user's computer (for example, reading or writing to C: drive).
   - Connect to any network server other than the one it was downloaded from (to prevent malicious network access).

2. MODERN REPLACEMENT:
   The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has completely replaced Java Applets.
   Example: A simple bouncing text animation using modern web tech.

   HTML:
   <p id="text">Bilal Muktar</p>

   CSS:
   #text {
       position: relative;
       animation: bounce 2s linear infinite;
   }

   @keyframes bounce {
       0% { left: 0; }
       100% { left: 300px; }
   }

   JavaScript is not even required for this simple animation, but could be used for interactivity or dynamic updates.

3. LEGACY:
   It is still important for developers to know what applets are because:
   - Many older enterprise systems or educational materials reference applets.
   - Understanding applets helps in learning about the history of client-side Java, browser security models, and the evolution toward web standards like HTML5 and JavaScript.
